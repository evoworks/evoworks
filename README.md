## Overview

The research activities of the group are organized into two broad programs, which reflect different levels of biological complexity and function. The first is focused on functional diversity at the gene and genome level, and the goal here is to study molecular evolutionary processes in the context of explicit changes in organism phenotype. The group is developing modeling frameworks for gene and genome data.  The second focuses on the diversity of complex assemblages of species genomes ("metagenomes"), and the goal here is to model the structure and function of complex communities (e.g., “microbiomes”). Both programs are integrated within our work on theoretical questions about the evolutionary dynamics of multilevel selection and multi-species phenotypic adaptations.
