## Overview

We are a research group located at Dalhousie University in Canada ([Bielawski research group page](http://www.bielawski.info)). The research activities of the group are organized into two broad areas, which reflect different levels of biological complexity and function. The first is focused on functional diversity at the gene and genome level, and the goal here is to study molecular evolutionary processes in the context of change in organism phenotype. We develop modeling frameworks for gene and genome data.  The second focuses on the diversity of complex assemblages of species genomes ("metagenomes"), with the goal of modelling the structure and function of complex communities (e.g., “microbiomes”). Both programs are integrated within our work on theoretical questions about the evolutionary dynamics of multilevel selection and multi-species phenotypic adaptations.
